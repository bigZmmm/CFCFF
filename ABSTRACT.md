There are two folders: the **"Planners"** folder contains the two planners CGCFF$_{\omega_1}$ and CGCFF$_{\omega_2}$ implemented in the paper "On the Integration of Conformant-FF into Counter-example Guided Abstraction Refinement Approach" while the **"Benchmark"** folder includes all the domains required to run the experiments presented in the paper "On the Integration of Conformant-FF into Counter-example Guided Abstraction Refinement Approach"
